InceptionResNetV2: InceptionResNetV2 is a convolutional neural network that is 164 layers deep, trained on millions of images from the ImageNet database, and can classify images into more than 1000 categories such as flowers, animals, etc. The input size of the images is 299-by-299.

Dataset description:

The dataset used comprises of 120 breeds of dogs in total.
Each image has a file name which is its unique id.
Train dataset ( train.zip ): contains 10,222 images which are to be used for training our model
Test dataset (test.zip ): contains 10,357 images which we have to classify into the respective categories or labels.
labels.csv: contains breed names corresponding to the image id.
sample_submission.csv: contains correct form of sample submission to be made
